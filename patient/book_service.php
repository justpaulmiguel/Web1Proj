                    It is called to the procedure done for the teeth
                    cleaning. It removes tartar and plaque build-up from the
                    surfaces of the teeth as well as those hidden in between
                    and under the gums. Some of the benefits of having an
                    oral prophylaxis are to Prevent Tooth Decay, Prevents
                    Gum Disease, Prevents Bad Breath, Removes Extrinsic
                    Stains, Lowers Risk for Diseases, Early detection of
                    Diseases and Financial Savings. Oral prophylaxis is
                    recommended to be done twice a year as a preventive
                    measure but should be performed every 3-4 months for
                    patients with more severe periodontal disease.

                    <img src="../home/images/Dental Fillings.jpg" /><br />
                    Dental filling is used to treat a small hole, or cavity,
                    in a tooth. To repair a cavity, a dentist removes the
                    decayed tooth tissue and then fills the space with a
                    filling material. We offer several dental filling
                    materials. Teeth can be filled with porcelain; silver
                    amalgam (which consists of mercury mixed with silver,
                    tin, zinc, and copper); or tooth-colored, plastic, and
                    materials called composite resin fillings. There is also
                    a material that contains glass particles and is known as
                    glass ionomer. This material is used in ways like the
                    use of composite resin fillings. Materials depends on
                    the availability.

                    Tooth Jacket <br />(Dental Crown)

                    <img src="../home/images/Tooth Jacket.jpg" /><br />
                    A tooth jacket (also known as a dental crown) is a false
                    tooth that comes in a variety of material made to be
                    placed on a severely damaged tooth. Essentially, this a
                    tooth jacket caps off a severely damaged tooth
                    protecting it from further damage and replacing it the
                    same time. How is a tooth jacket is placed on your
                    teeth? To keep it simple, a dentist will file the
                    affected tooth down to size. This is to make room for
                    the dental crown that goes on top of the tooth. Usually,
                    the dentist will give you a temporary crown or jacket to
                    wear while the actual crown is being made. The waiting
                    time can be from a few days all the way up to a week or
                    two.

                    Wisdom Tooth <br />Extraction
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    <img src="../home/images/Wisdom Tooth Extraction.jpg" /><br />
                    Wisdom tooth extraction is a surgical procedure to
                    remove one or more wisdom teeth â€” the four permanent
                    adult teeth located at the back corners of your mouth on
                    the top and bottom. If a wisdom tooth doesn't have room
                    to grow (impacted wisdom tooth), resulting in pain,
                    infection or other dental problems, you'll likely need
                    to have it pulled. This service may be done by a dentist
                    or an oral surgeon and to prevent potential future
                    problems, some dentists and oral surgeons recommend
                    wisdom tooth extraction even if impacted teeth aren't
                    currently causing problems.
